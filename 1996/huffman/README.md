the source and it will be clear as mud!

And for a misleading hint, consider who won!  :-)


### NOTICE to those who wish for a greater challenge:

**If you want a greater challenge, don't read any further**:
just try to understand the program without running the command below.

If you get stuck, come back and run the following command:

``` <!---sh-->
    ./huffman < huffman.c 2>/dev/null
```

This entry was very well received at the [IOCCC BOF](../../faq.html#ioccc_bof).


## Author's remarks:

This filter program is really not obfuscated code.  It compiles cleanly
with an ANSI C compiler and comes with user documentation that even a
blind person could read.

The program is a bidirectional filter with the output of the program
suitable for its input.  The output of this program, when used as input,
undoes the original program filtering.

This program accepts any alphanumeric text that has lines less than 100
characters.  The user is encouraged to use the program's source as input
to the executable.

This program is best appreciated on a tactile monitor.
